# Simple Calculator
### This is a basic project on a simple calculator, which has only the 4 major operations of a calculator i.e Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.
### => I used basic fuctions like print(), input(), int(), if(), elif() and in().

### => I also used def() to define the mathamatical operations into user-defines functions.

### => As it is clear from the above picture I stared off by define the operations Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide.
### => Then I made an invitation and asked which operation out of the 4 the user wants to do.

### => I gave an input option to type in first number and second number, and made it only integer acceptable.

### => The "\n" is used so that in the output the cursor goes to the next line.
### => After that I made sure that whatever operation the user selected only that operation is getting used. For example if the user chooses "1", the program makes sure that the operation used is Addition.

### => And I used elif() for other choices and other operations.
### => In the end i looped the program if the user would like to do another calculation.

### => This is the sample out put of this program.
